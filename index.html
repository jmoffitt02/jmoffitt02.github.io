		 My name is Jackson Moffitt. I grew up in Stillwater Minnesota in a family of four. In highschool I played basketball, football, and  golf. Whenever I get the chance I still love to golf today. It is a personal goal of mine to play Golf in many different countries. I am also a junior studying mechaincal engineering at UW-Madison. I chose engineering because of my passion for math and science and my fascination with understanding how things are made and how the world works. In the future I would love to work in the automotive industry specifically in the design of electric vehicles. In my free time I love to go to the gym, explore the oputdoors, and watch a good movie. I also am involed in undergardauate research and a couple of organizations which you can find out more about below. I am always looking to expand my network so feel free to connect with my on LinkedIn. A fun fact about me is that I can juggle and I have visited 7 different countries.</p>
