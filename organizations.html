		<h2 class="center">Badger Cru</h2>
		<p> Badger Cru is a christian organization on campus here at UW. I have been involved in it since my freshman year. We do all sorts of events and our goal is to be a place where we can love on people and share the gospel with those on campus. Cru has been an amazing experience because of all the amazing friendships I have formed through it and the ways I have grown stronger in my faith.</p>

		<h2 class="center">Badger Loop</h2>
		<p>Badger loop is an organization on campus who's goal is to build and race an electric vehicle. It is such a cool club because you really create a vehicle from the ground up and you learn a lot about all of the parts and steps which go into designing and manufacturing a full vehicle. I have been a part of the braking and chassis subteam for the car and our goal is to have a working vehicle by the summer to be able to compete in the national competition.</p>
