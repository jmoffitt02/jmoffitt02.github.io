			<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
			<p>
				Through our research, we strive to support and enhance design innovation and creativity.  Our approach is interdisciplinary and mixed
				methodological, focusing on understanding and supporting design innovation through design cognition research, methodological and
				computational design support development.
			</p>

		<h2>My Research</h2>
		<p>
			<h4>Engineer Knowledge Acquisition</h4>
			<p>Studying how mechanical engineers as designers use, acquire, and integrate knowledge in design. We are currently perfroming a literature review on these topics. We are also in the process of planning a study to be conducted on professional engineers to see how bias 
				presents itself in basic design practice
			</p>
			<h4>Energy Justice</h4>
			<p>Looking at the concept of energy justice and how it is currently being implemented in the science field. Conducted a survey at <b>NREL</b> asking their engineers and scientists what they know about energy justice. We are currently doing statistical and qualitative analysis on the responses to look for trends. Our goal is to develop a methodology which can be integrated into current practice which can further educate/highlight energy justice concepts in the scientific process</p>
